# Neural Networks and Deep Learning
- AI is the new electricity
- NN: input layer, connected layer. Every input layer feature is interconnected with every hidden layer feature
- Terms revised: Supervised Learning, Structured vs. Unstructured data, CNN, RNN
- Why is deep learning taking off -- scale drives deep learning performance. Scale = size of the NN or the amount of data
  - progress in data, computation, algorithms
 
  
Logistic Regression as a Neural Network Problem
- Binary classification: stack features and outputs as columns
- Logistic Regression: given x, find the probability that y = 1
